<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter, as making themselves ready, <span class="smcap">Tim Bloodhound</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Sim</span> the man.</em>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> Good morrow, Master Tim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Morrow, Sim; my father stirring, Sim?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> Not yet, I think; he heard some ill-news
of your brother Alexander last night, that will
make him lie an hour extraordinary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Hum: I'm sorry the old man should lie
by the hour; but, O, these wicked elder brothers,
that swear refuse them,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and drink nothing but
wicked sack; when we swear nothing but niggers-noggers,
make a meal of a bloat herring, water it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>with four-shillings' beer, and then swear we have
dined as well as my lord mayor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> Here was goody Fin, the fishwoman,
fetched home her ring last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> You should have put her money by itself,
for fear of wronging of the whole heap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> So I did, sir, and washed it first in two
waters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> All these petty pawns, sirrah, my father
commits to my managing, to instruct me in this
craft that, when he dies, the commonwealth may
not<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> want a good member.</p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="smcap">Mistress Mary</span>.</em>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> Nay, you are cursed as much as he already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mis. Mary.</span> O brother, 'tis well you are up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Why, why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mis. Mary.</span> Now you shall see the dainty
widow, the sweet widow, the delicate widow,
that to-morrow morning must be our mother-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> What, the widow Wag?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> Yes, yes; she that dwells in Blackfriars,
next to the sign of the Fool laughing at a feather.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mis. Mary.</span> She, she; good brother, make
yourself handsome, for my father will bring her
hither presently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Niggers-noggers, I thought he had been
sick, and had not been up, Sim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> Why, so did I too; but it seems the widow
took him at a better hand, and raised him so much
the sooner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> While I tie my band, prythee stroke up
my foretop a little: niggers, an' I had but dreamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>of this an hour before I waked, I would have put
on my Sunday clothes. 'Snails, my shoes are pale
as the cheek of a stewed pander; a clout, a clout,
Sim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> More haste the worse speed; here's ne'er
a clout now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> What's that lies by the hooks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> This? 'tis a sumner's coat.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Prythee, lend's a sleeve of that; he had a
noble on't last night, and never paid me my bill-money.</p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="smcap">Old Bloodhound</span>, the <span class="smcap">Widow</span>, her <span class="smcap">Maid</span>,

widow. He is in some deep discourse with Sim,
concerning moneys out to one or another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Has he said his prayers, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> Prayer before providence! When did
ye know any thrive and swell that uses it? He's
a chip o' th' old block; I exercise him in the trade
of thrift, by turning him to all the petty pawns.
If they come to me, I tell them I have given over
brokering, moiling for muck and trash, and that I
mean to live a life monastic, a praying life: pull
out the tale of Cr&#339;sus from my pocket, and swear
'tis called "Charity's Looking-Glass, or an exhortation
to forsake the world."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maid.</span> Dainty hypocrite!       <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Peace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> But let a fine fool that's well-feathered
come, and withal good meat, I have a friend, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>may be, that may compassionate his wants. I'll

is furnished with no other.</p>

I thought it had been our old collier. Did you go
to bed with that dirty face, goodman File?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> And rise with it too, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> What have you bumming out there, goodman
File?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> A vice, sir, that I would fain be furnished
with a little money upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Why, how will you do to work then, goodman
File?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> This is my spare vice, not that I live by.</p>

spirits, and abounding with superfluous sums of money,
were assembled, it will not seem wonderful to find the
liberty granted at this season should be productive of many
irregularities. Among others, gaming, in the reign of
James I., when this play was probably written, had been
carried to such an extravagant height as to demand the
interposition of the heads of some of the societies to prevent
the evil consequences attending it. In the 12th of
James I. orders for reformation and better government of
the inns of court and Chancery were made by the readers
and benchers of the four houses of court; among which is
the following:&mdash;"For that disorders in the <em>Christmas</em>-time,
may both infect the minds, and prejudice the estates and
fortunes, of the young gentlemen in the same societies: it
is therefore ordered, that there shall be commons of the
house kept, in every house of court, during the <em>Christmas</em>;
and that none shall play in their several halls at the dice,
except he be a gentleman of the same society, and in commons;
and the benefits of the boxes to go to the butlers of
every house respectively."&mdash;Dugdale's "Orig. Jurid.," p.
318. In the 4th of Car. I. (Nov. 17) the society of Gray's
Inn direct, "that all playing at dice, cards, or otherwise, in
the hall, buttry, or butler's chamber, should be thenceforth
barred and forbidden, at all times of the year, the twenty
days in <em>Christmas</em> only excepted."&mdash;<cite>Ibid.</cite> p. 286. And in
the 7th of Car. I. (7th Nov.) the society of the <em>Inner Temple</em>
made several regulations for keeping good rule in <em>Christmas-time</em>,
two of which will show how much gaming had been
practised there before that time. "8. That there shall not
be any knocking with boxes, or calling aloud for gamesters.
9. That no play be continued within the house upon any
Saturday night, or upon Christmas-eve at night, after twelve
of the clock."
</p>
<p>
Sir Simon D'Ewes also, in the MS. life of himself in the
British Museum, takes notice of the Christmas irregularities
about this period (p. 52, Dec. 1620)&mdash;"At the saied Temple
was a lieutenant chosen, and much gaming, and other excesses
increased during these festivall dayes, by his residing
and keeping a standing table ther; and, when sometimes I
turned in thither to behold ther sportes, and saw the many
oaths, execrations, and quarrels, that accompanied ther dicing,
I began seriously to loath it, though at the time I conceived
the sporte of itselfe to bee lawfull."&mdash;["Life of
D'Ewes," edit. 1845, i. 161.] "The first day of Januarie
[<em>i.e.</em>, 1622-23] at night, I came into commons at the Temple,
wheere ther was a lieftenant choosen, and all manner of
gaming and vanitie practiced, as if the church had not at
all groaned under those heavie desolations which it did.
Wherefore I was verie gladd, when, on the Tuesday following,
being the seventh day of the same moneth, the howse
broake upp ther Christmas, and added an end to those excesses."&mdash;[Life,
<em>ut supr.</em>, i. 223.]
</p>
<p>
To what excess gaming was carried on in the inns-of-court
at this period may be judged from the following circumstance,
that in taking up the floor of one of the Temple
halls about 1764, near one hundred pair of dice were found,
which had dropt at times through the chinks or joints of
the boards. They were very small, scarce more than two-thirds
as large as our modern ones. The hall was built in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth. [See on this subject "Popular
Antiquities of Great Britain," i., where copious collections
will be found upon this subject.]</p></div>

<em>copsmate</em>, a companion in drinking, or one that dwells under
the same <em>cope</em>, or house. I find the word used in "The
Curtain-Drawer of the World," 1612, p. 31, but not according
to either of the above explanations. "Hee that trusts a
tradesman on his word, a usurer with his bond, a phisitian
with his body, and the divell with his soule, needes not care
who he trusts afterwards, nor what <em>copesmate</em> encounters
him next."
</p>
<p>
<em>Copesmate</em>, I believe, means only <em>companion</em>, a word which
was used both in a bad and good sense by our ancestors.
To <em>cope</em> is to meet with, to encounter. Thus Hamlet&mdash;

has heard such histories, that he will marry you,
though he never saw you; and that the parboiled
&AElig;tna of his bosom might be quenched by the
consequent pastime in the Prittish flames of his
Prittish plood, he salutes you with that love-letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moll.</span> This is a mad lover, indeed; prythee,

<p><span class="smcap">Sim.</span> Mass, h' has writ it in the Welsh-English;
we had been spoiled else for want of an interpreter.

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> He wonnot murder me, will he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> He shall not touch you: only, I remember,
this afternoon this fellow, by what he had gathered
by eavesdropping, or by frequent observation,
asked me privately if there were no meeting
betwixt you and my mistress to-night in this place,
for a widow, he said, he knew you were to
meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> Now I handsomely threw dust in's eyes,
and yet kept the plot swift afoot too. I told him
you were here to meet a widow too, whom you long
loved, but would not let her know't till this afternoon,
naming to him one of my aunts<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, a widow by
Fleet-ditch. Her name is Mistress Gray, and keeps

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> To turn the scent then, and to cheat inquisition
the more ingeniously&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> And to bob Sir Nicholas most neatly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> Be sure, all this night, in the hearing of
any that you shall but suspect to be within hearing,
to call her nothing but Mistress Coote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> Or Widow Coote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> Yes, you may put her in so; but be sure
you cohere in every particle with the precedent
fallacy, as that you have loved her long, though
till this day&mdash;and so as I did demonstrate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> But how an' she should say she is not
Widow Coote, and that she knows no such woman,
and so spoil all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> Trust that with her wit and my instructions.
We suspected a spy, and therefore she will
change her voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> Thou hast a delicate mistress of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> One thing more, and you meet presently.
Mine aunt has had nine husbands; tell her you'll
hazard a limb, and make the tenth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> Prythee, let me alone; and Sir Nicholas

<p><span class="smcap">Jar.</span> [<em>To <span class="smcap">Mistress Coote</span>.</em>] Go forwards

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> Who's there? Widow Coote?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mis. Coote.</span> Master Bloodhound, as I take it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood.</span> She changes her voice bravely. I must
tell thee, true widow, I have loved thee a long
time (look how the rogue looks!), but had never
the wit to let thee know it till to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mis. Coote.</span> So I was given to understand,

act iv. sc. 5), "was anciently supposed to strengthen
the memory; and was not only carried at funerals, but
worn at weddings." See the several instances there quoted.
Again, in Dekker's "Wonderful Yeare," 1603: "Heere is
a strange alteration; for the <em>rosemary</em> that was washt in
sweet water to set out the bridall, is now wet in teares to
furnish her buriall."
</p>
<p>
Again, in "The Old Law," act iv. sc. 1: "Besides,
there will be charges saved, too; the same <em>rosemary</em> that
serves for the funeral will serve for the wedding."

It appears also to have been customary to drink wine at
church, immediately after the marriage ceremony was performed.
So in Dekker's "Satiro-mastix:" "And, Peter,
when we are at church, bring <em>wine</em> and cakes." At
the marriage of the Elector Palatine with the Princess
Elizabeth, daughter of James the First, it is said, "In conclusion,
a joy pronounced by the king and queen, and
seconded with congratulations of the lords there present,
which crowned with draughts of <em>Ippocras</em>, out of a great
golden bowle, as a health to the prosperitie of the marriage
(began by the Prince Palatine, and answered by the Princess),
after which were served up by six or seaven barons, so many
bowles filled with wafers, so much of that worke was consummate."&mdash;Finett's
"Philoxenis," 1656, fol. 11.</p></div>

The original signification seems to have been descriptive
of the different kinds of horses, cuts, curtails, and longtails,
and hence it came to mean generally <em>all sorts and
kinds</em>, like the modern term. Compare Dyce's "Shakespeare
Glossary," 1868, in <em>v.</em>] This phrase occurs in "The
Merry Wives of Windsor," act iii. sc. 4. Steevens says
the origin of it was from Forest Laws, by which the dog of
a man who had no right to the privilege of chase, was
obliged to be cut or lawed; and amongst other modes of disabling
him, one was by depriving him of his tail. <em>Cut</em> and
<em>long tail</em> therefore signified the dog of a clown and the dog
of a gentleman. [Reed (more correctly) remarks:] "<em>Cut and
long tail</em>, I apprehend referred originally to horses, when
their tails were either docked, or left to grow their full
length; and this distinction might formerly be made according
to their qualities and values. A horse therefore used
for drudgery might have his tail cut, while the tails of those
which served for pomp or show, might be allowed their
utmost growth. A <em>cut</em> appears to have been the term used
for a bad horse in many contemporary writers, and from
thence to call a person <em>cut</em> became a common opprobrious
word employed by the vulgar, when they abused each other.
See note to 'Gammer Gurton's Needle' [iii. 211.] In confirmation
of this idea, it may be added, that Sim says in the text,
<em>Some horse taught him that</em>, which naturally introduces the
phrase <em>cut and long tail</em> into the Constable's answer. The
words <em>cut and long tail</em> occur also in 'The Return from
Parnassus,' act iv. sc. 1: 'As long as it lasts, come <em>cut
and long tail</em>, we'll spend it as liberally for his sake.'
There seems no doubt that <em>cut and long tail</em> has reference
to horses. Sir J. Vanbrugh, in his '&AElig;sop,' so employs
the phrase: the groom says, 'Your worship has six coach
horses, <em>cut and long tail</em>, two runners, half a dozen hunters,'
&amp;c."&mdash;<cite>Collier.</cite></p></div>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>Robert Davenport is a writer (remarks Reed) of
whom scarce any particulars are known. It appears,
from the office-book of Sir Henry Herbert, that Davenport
had licence for the "History of Henry the First"
on the 10th April, 1624; and this is the earliest
memorandum relating to him with which we have
met. His dramatic productions are&mdash;</p>


<p>1. "The History of Henry the First," not printed.</p>

<p>2. "A Pleasant and Witty Comedy, called a New
Trick to Cheat the Devil," 1639, 4<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p>3. "King John and Matilda," 1655, 4<sup>o</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>4. "The Pirate," not printed.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>5. "The Woman's Mistaken," not printed.</p>

<p>6. "The Fatal Brothers," not printed.</p>

<p>7. "The Politic Queen," not printed.</p>

<p>8. "The City Nightcap," 1661, 4<sup>o</sup>. Licensed Oct.
24, 1624.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>He has also been credited with a piece called "The
Pedlar," licensed to Robert Allot, April 8, 1630; but
this production, under the title of "The Conceited
Pedlar," is printed at the end of Allot's edition of
Randolph's "Aristippus," 4<sup>o</sup>, 1630. It is, of course,
included in Hazlitt's edition of Randolph, 12<sup>o</sup>, 1875.</p>

<p>Davenport, besides his plays, was the author of a
considerable collection of poems, the greater part of
which were not published. In 1639, however, appeared
a thin 4<sup>o</sup> volume, entitled "A Crowne for a Conqueror;
and Too late to call backe yesterday. Two
Poems, the one Divine, the other Morall. By R. D."
In the Bodleian Catalogue this little book is misdated
1623.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The latter piece is dedicated to his noble
friends, as he calls them, Mr Richard Robinson<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and
Mr Michael Bowyer; and in his address to them he
styles both the poems some of the expense of his time
at sea. From the address prefixed to the play of
"King John and Matilda," signed R. D., he appears to
have been alive in the year 1655, when that piece was
first published.</p>

him! if he but screw his look sometimes with the

nor drink, nor talk, but against new fashions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lod.</span> O sir, she is my crown: nor is it requisite
women should be so sociable. I have had such a

not drink a cup of wine, unless nine parts of it
were water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lod.</span> Nay, and ye knew all, my lords, ye would
say so. T'other day I brought an English gentleman

him: he (as ye know their custom, though it be

left her lips.</p>

she, A kiss, sir, is sin's earnest-penny. Is't not
true, Pambo?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clown.</span> Very true, sir. By the same token,
quoth he to her again, if you dislike the penny,
lady, pray let me change it into English halfpence,
and so gave her two for't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lod.</span> But how she vexed then! Then she
rattled him, and told him roundly, though confidence
made cuckolds in England, she could no coxcombs

not so many cuckolds in England, but craft picks
open more padlocks in Italy.</p>

pressed or trodden upon, and to this circumstance the Clown
here alludes. Frequent notice is taken of this property in
the plant by our ancient writers. As in Tofte's "Honours
Academie, or the Famous Pastorall of the Faire Shepheardesse
Julietta," 1610, p. 204, 5th part: "But as gold taken out
of the burning furnace, is farre more bright and fierce, than
when it was first flung in; and as <em>Camomell, the more it is
trod upon, the thicker and better it groweth</em>: even so we see
this faire Archeresh to shew more cleare and beautifull,
when the flame was once past and gone then she had bene
before."
</p>
<p>
And in the "First Part of King Henry IV.," act ii. sc. 4:
"For though <em>the camomile the more it is trodden on, the
faster it grows</em>, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner
it wears."
</p>

Farmer on the last passage.</p></div>

"Antony and Cleopatra," act iv. sc. 10), "is a term to signify
a cheating game, of which the following is a description. A
leathern belt is made up into a number of intricate folds, and
placed edgewise upon a table. One of the folds is made to
represent the middle of the girdle, so that whoever should
thrust a skewer into it would think he held it fast to the
table; whereas, when he has so done, the person with whom
he plays may take hold of both ends and draw it away. The
trick is now known to the common people by the name of
pricking at the belt or girdle." The Gipsies, so early as the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, were great adepts in these practices.
See Scot's "Discoverie of witchcraft," 1584, p. 336; where in
the 29th chapter is described the manner of playing at <em>fast
and loose</em> with handkerchiefs, &amp;c.</p></div></div>

<p>
Again, "An archer saye you, is to be knowen by his aime,

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Jasper Mayne was born at Hatherley, in Devonshire,
in the year 1604; and being sent to Westminster School,
he continued there until the age of nineteen years, without
obtaining a King's scholarship. At that time he
met with a patron in Dr Bryan Duppa; by whose recommendation,
in 1623, he entered himself a servitor
of Christ Church, Oxford, and commenced M.A. June
18, 1631. He afterwards took holy orders, and distinguished
himself in the pulpit by that quaint manner of
preaching which was then in vogue. His first preferment
was the vicarage of Cassington, near Woodstock,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
to which was afterwards added the living of Pyrton, near
Watlington, both by the presentation of his college.
These preferments lying at a small distance from the
university, he continued to reside there, and was much
admired for his wit and humour. In 1638 he completed
a translation of Lucian's Dialogues;<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and in the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>year appeared his comedy of "The City-Match." On
the breaking out of the civil war, he sided with the
royal party, to which he remained ever after firmly
attached. He was appointed in 1642 one of the divines
to preach before the king and Parliament, in that year
proceeded Bachelor of Divinity, and was created D.D.
on June 7, 1646. The decline of the king's affairs caused
a very great alteration in those of our author: he was
ejected from his student's place in 1648, and soon after
deprived of both his vicarages. In the midst of these
sufferings he still preserved a warm zeal for the old
establishment. In September 1652, he held a public
disputation with a noted Anabaptist preacher, in Watlington
Church. He afterwards had the good fortune
to meet with a friend in the Earl of Devonshire, who
received him into his family in the character of chaplain,
and with that nobleman he resided until the Restoration.
On that event he returned back to his livings, was appointed
chaplain-in-ordinary to the king, promoted to
a canon's stall at Christ Church, and raised to the dignity
of Archdeacon of Chichester.</p>

<p>Thus replaced in his favourite seat of the Muses, he
continued to reside there during the rest of his life,
happy in the full enjoyment of his promotions. He
died December 6, 1672, and his corpse was interred
in the aisle adjoining to the choir of Christ Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>where a monument was erected to his memory at the
charge of Dr Robert South and Dr John Lamphire, the
executors of his will.</p>

<p>Besides the translation of Lucian (before mentioned)
and "The City-Match,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> he published several sermons
and poems,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and "The Amorous War:" a tragi-comedy.
4<sup>o</sup>, 1648.</p>

<p>["The City-Match" is an excellent comedy of intrigue
and counter-plot, with many amusing and lively situations,
and frequent illustrations of manners. The character
of Dorcas, however, is forced, and her sudden
metamorphosis is wanting in probability.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<h3>TO THE READER.</h3>

<p>The Author of this Poem, knowing how hardly
the best things protect themselves from censure,
had no ambition to make it this way public, holding
works of this light nature to be things which
need an apology for being written at all, nor esteeming
otherwise of them, whose abilities in this
kind are most passable, than of masquers who
spangle and glitter for the time, but 'tis th[o]rough
tinsel. As it was merely out of obedience that he
first wrote it, so when it was made, had it not been
commanded from him, it had died upon the place
where it took life. Himself being so averse from
raising fame from the stage, that at the presentment
he was one of the severest spectators there,
nor ever showed other sign whereby it might be
known to be his but his liberty to despise it. Yet
he hath at length consented it should pass the
press; not with an aim to purchase a new reputation,
but to keep that which he hath already from
growing worse; for understanding that some at
London, without his approbation or allowance,
were ready to print a false, imperfect copy, he was
loth to be libelled by his own work, or that his
play should appear to the world with more than its
own faults. Farewell.</p>

expresses that it was "made English from the original in
the year 1638." This fact also appears from the dedication
to the Marquis of Newcastle, which is a masterpiece of solid
reasoning and critical acumen, where the author mentions
that "these pieces were translated for your private entertainment
above five-and-twenty years since." He adds that
he was then only a student of Christ Church, and that he
should have translated more "if the late barbarous times
had not broke my study." In the course of this preface
(for the epistle is to be so considered) Mayne very severely
lashes the republicans for their ignorance and presumptuousness.&mdash;<cite>Collier</cite>

<p><a name="Footnote_194_194" id="Footnote_194_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> "<em>Talc</em>, in natural history, is a shining, squamous, fissile
species of stone, easily separable into thin, transparent
scales or leaves."&mdash;Chambers's "Dictionary." It was
anciently found only in Spain, but since, in several parts of
Europe, Asia, and Africa. "Some chemists," says the same
writer, "and other empirics, have held that talc might be
used for many important purposes, and pretend to draw
from it that precious oil so much boasted of by the ancients,
particularly the Arabs, called <em>oil of talc</em>, which is supposed
a wonderful cosmetic, and preserver of the complexion; but
the truth is, the word <em>talc</em>, among them, signified no more
than an equal disposition of the humours, which keeps the
body in good temperament and perfect health. Now, as
nothing contributes more than health to the preserving of
beauty, this has given occasion to the chemists to search this
<em>oil of talc</em>, which is to maintain the body in this disposition,
and to engage the ladies to be at the expense of the
search."
</p>
<p>
["<em>Talc</em> is a cheap kind of mineral, which this county
(Sussex) plentifully affords, though not so fine as that which
is fetched from Venice. It is white and transparent like
crystal, full of strekes or veins, which prettily scatter
themselves. Being calcined, and variously prepared, it
maketh a curious <em>white-wash</em>, which some justify lawful,
because clearing, not changing, the complexion."&mdash;Fuller's
"Worthies," quoted by Gifford (Ben Jonson, iv. 94).]</p></div>

at Mortlake, in Surrey, and soon arrived at a high degree of
excellence. King James gave &pound;2000 towards the undertaking;
and Sir Francis Crane erected the house to execute
the design in. Francis Cleyn painted for the workmen, and
to such a pitch of perfection had the art been carried, that
Archbishop Williams paid for the four seasons, worked, I
suppose, for hangings, &pound;2500.&mdash;(Walpole's "Anecdotes,"

by the space of fourteen yeeres together; that is, from the
yeere of her age twenty-two to thirty-six, and from the
yeere of our Lord, 1597 to 1611; and this we have confirmed
by the testimony of the magistrate of the towne of
Meurs, as also by the minister, who made tryall of her in
his house thirteene days together, by all the meanes he
could devise, but could detect no imposture. Over the

was quoted by that gentleman. See notes on "Twelfth

sc. 2) that it was formerly very common to exhibit fishes,
either real or imaginary, in this manner, and that it appears
from the books of Stationers' Hall, that in 1604 was published,
"A strange reporte of a monstrous <em>fish</em>, that appeared
in the form of a woman from her waist upward, seene in the
sea."

we employ the phrase "a strange fish." "Nuovo pesce era

patronage of Charles I., undertook the repairing and rebuilding
of St Paul's. On this occasion the king went to
the cathedral, and, after divine service was performed,
solemnly promised to exert his best endeavours to repair
the ruins which time, or the casualties of weather, had
made therein. In consequence of this scheme, many applications
were made to noblemen and gentlemen for their assistance,
and, on their refusal to contribute, some were very
severely censured, and even fined.</p></div>

by Charles I., after he determined to govern without a
parliament; the borrowing of money by writs of privy-seal
was one not the least burdensome and oppressive. The
manner was to direct these writs to particular persons by
name, requiring the loan of money, or plate to the amount
of the money, to be paid or delivered to a particular person,
for the king's use. The form of the writs may be seen in
"The Parliamentary History," xiii., 84, where one of them
is printed. [But in this passage this speaker also intends
a play on the double meaning of <em>seal</em>.]</p></div>

we learn that the office of a Reader at the Middle Temple
was held at a great charge to the person who executed it.
"His expences," says that author, "during this time of
<em>reading</em>, are very great; insomuch, as some have spent
above six hundred pounds in two dayes less than a fortnight,
which now is the usual time of <em>reading</em>." It appears
also that many gentlemen, who were put by their <em>reading</em>,
were removed from the Bar-table unto a table called, The
Auncients Table; "And it is no disgrace," says the same
author, "for any man to be removed hither; for by reason
of the excessive chardge of <em>readings</em>, many men of great
learning and competent practise, as well as others of less
learning, but great estates, have refused to Read, and are
here placed." To relieve the gentlemen who undertook
this expensive office, it seems to have been usual to call
upon the students for their assistance; and this circumstance
is alluded to in the text. [The Ancients' Table is
the same as the Benchers', and at Gray's Inn the Benchers
are still called <em>Ancients</em>.]</p></div></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>William Habington, the son of Thomas Habington,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
of Hendlip, in the county of Worcester, Esq., was born
at the seat of his father, on the 4th, or, as others say,
the 5th, of November 1605.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> He received his education
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>at St Omers and Paris, and at the former of these
places was earnestly solicited to become one of the
order of the Jesuits. On his return from Paris, being
then at man's estate, he was instructed at home in
matters of history by his father, and became an accomplished
gentleman. He married Lucia, daughter of
William Lord Powis, and is charged by Wood with
running with the times, and being not unknown to
Oliver Cromwell. He died the 30th of November
1654, and was buried in the vault at Hendlip, by the
bodies of his father and grandfather.</p>

<p>Besides the play now republished, he was the author
of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Poems, under the title of "Castara," 4<sup>o</sup>, 1634; 12<sup>o</sup>,
1635, 1640.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> They are divided into three parts, each
under a different title, suitable to the subject: the first,
written when he was suitor to his wife, is ushered in
by a character of a mistress, written in prose: the
second contains verses written to her after marriage;
after which is a character of a friend, before several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>funeral elegies: and the third consists of Divine Poems,
preceded by the portrait of a holy man.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>2. "Observations upon History." 8<sup>o</sup>, 1641.</p>

<p>3. "History of Edward IV., King of England," f<sup>o</sup>,
1640, written and published at the desire of King
Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Wood observes that the MSS. which our author and
his father left<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> were then in the hands of the former's
son, and might be made useful for the public, if in the
possession of any other person.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_264_264" id="Footnote_264_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_264_264"><span class="label">[264]</span></a> This Thomas Habington was born 26th October 1560,
and married Mary, the sister of Lord Mounteagle, the lady
who is supposed to have written that letter to her brother
which occasioned the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot.
For harbouring Garnet and Alchorne, two Popish priests, he
is said to have been condemned to die, but by the intercession
of Lord Mounteagle he was reprieved and pardoned.
He lived many years afterwards, not dying until the 8th of
October 1647, at the advanced age of eighty-seven years.
Wood says he surveyed the county of Worcester, and made
a collection of most of its antiquities. He also translated
"The Epistle of Gildas, the most ancient British author,"
12<sup>o</sup>, 1638, and had a considerable hand in the "History of
Edward IV.," published by his son.</p></div>

1640, observes, "The first and second parts of these poems
were printed in 1634, 4<sup>o</sup>; again (with additions) in 1635, 12<sup>o</sup>;
and the third part was added in 1640. He is said to have
entitled his collection "Castara" in compliment to his
mistress, Lucia, daughter of Lord Powis, who became his
wife." This is evident from a poem on p. 102 of the
edition of 1640, addressed to Lord Powis, where he speaks
of his daughter as Castara.&mdash;<cite>Collier.</cite></p></div>

1675), says "that he may be ranked with those who deserve
neither the highest nor the lowest seat in the theatre
of fame." Mr Park is of opinion "that this character of
him is rather below par; for he appears (as an amatory
poet) to have possessed a superior degree of unaffected
tenderness and delicacy of sentiment to either Carew or
Waller, with an elegance of versification very seldom inferior
to his more famed contemporaries." Perhaps Habington's
"amiable piety," rendered him a peculiar favourite
with Mr Park.&mdash;<cite>Collier.</cite></p></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Shakerley Marmion was born at Aynho,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> near
Brackley, in the county of Northampton, where his
father was lord of the manor, and in possession of a
considerable estate. He received the early part of his
education at the free school, at Thame, in the county of
Oxford, under the care of Richard Boucher, commonly
called Butcher, the master thereof. In the year 1617
he became a gentleman-commoner of Wadham College,
in Oxford, and in 1624,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> took the degree of Master of
Arts. Anthony Wood<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> says that he was "a goodly
proper gentleman, and had once in his possession seven
hundred pounds per annum at least." The whole of
this ample fortune he dissipated; after which he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>into the Low Countries; but not meeting with promotion
according to his expectation, he returned to England,
and was admitted one of the troop raised by
Sir John Suckling for the use of King Charles I.

<p>2. "A Fine Companion,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> acted before the king and

servants, at the Cockpit. 1641." 4<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p>He also published "Cupid and Psyche; or an epick

<p>Prefixed to this are complimentary verses by Richard
Brome, Francis Tuckyr, Thomas Nabbes, and Thomas
Heywood.</p>

<p>Wood says he left some things in MS. ready for the
press, which were either lost or in obscure hands.</p>

<h2><a name="ACT_I_SCENE_I4" id="ACT_I_SCENE_I4">ACT I., SCENE I.</a></h2>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="smcap">Lionel</span> and <span class="smcap">Petrucio</span>.</em>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Now, sir, let me bid you welcome to your
country and the longing expectation of those
friends that have almost languished for the sight
of you. [<em>Aside.</em>] I must flatter him, and stroke
him too; he will give no milk else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> I have calculated by all the rules of reason
and art that I shall be a great man; for what
singular quality concurs to perfection and advancement
that is defective in me? Take my feature
and proportion; have they not a kind of sweetness
and harmony, to attract the eyes of the beholders?
the confirmation of which many authentical
judgments of ladies have sealed and subscribed
to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> How do you, sir? are you not well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Next, my behaviour and discourse, according
to the court-garb, ceremonious enough, more pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>mising
than substantial, able to keep pace with the
best hunting wit of them all: besides, Nature has
blessed me with boldness sufficient and fortune
with means. What then should hinder me?
Nothing but destiny, villanous destiny, that chains
virtue to darkness and obscurity. Well, I will
insinuate myself into the court and presence of the
duke; and if he have not the grace to distinguish
of worth, his ignorance upon him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> What, in a muse, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Cannot a gentleman ruminate over his
good parts, but you must be troubling of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Wise men and fools are alike ambitious:
this travelling motion<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> has been abroad in quest
of strange fashions, where his spongy brain has
sucked the dregs of all the folly he could possibly
meet with, and is indeed more ass than he went
forth. Had I an interest in his disgrace, I'd rail
at him, and perhaps beat him for it; but he is as
strange to me as to himself, therefore let him continue
in his beloved simplicity.                     <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Next, when he shall be instructed of my
worth and eminent sufficiencies, he cannot dignify
me with less employment than the dignity of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
embassador. How bravely shall I behave myself
in that service! and what an ornament unto my
country may I arrive to be, and to my kindred!
But I will play the gentleman, and neglect them;
that's the first thing I'll study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Shall I be bold to interrupt you, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Presently I'll be at leisure to talk with
you: 'tis no small point in state policy still to
pretend only to be thought a man of action, and
rather than want a colour, be busied with a man's
own self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Who does this ass speak to? surely to himself:
and 'tis impossible he should ever be wise
that has always such a foolish auditory.       <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Then, with what emulous courtship will
they strive to entertain me in foreign parts; and
what a spectacle of admiration shall I be made
amongst those who have formerly known me! How
dost thou like my carriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Most exquisite, believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> But is it adorned with that even mixture
of fluency and grace as are required both in a
statist and a courtier?<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> So far as the divine prospect of my understanding
guides me, 'tis without parallel most
excellent; but I am no professed critic in the
mystery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Well, thou hast Linceus' eyes for observation,
or could'st ne'er have made such a cunning
discovery of my practice. But will the ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
think you, have that apprehension to discern and
approve of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Without question; they cannot be so dull or
stony-hearted as not to be infinitely taken with
your worth. Why, in a while, you shall have them
so enamoured that they'll watch every opportunity
to purchase your acquaintance; then again revive it
with often banqueting and visits; nay, and perhaps
invite others, by their foolish example, to do
the like; and some, that despair of so great happiness,
will inquire out your haunts, and walk there
two or three hours together, to get but a sight of
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> O infinite! I am transported with the
thought on't! It draws near noon, and I appointed
certain gallants to meet me at the five-crown ordinary:
after, we are to wait upon the like beauties
you talked of to the public theatre. I feel of late
a strong and witty genius growing upon me, and
I begin, I know not how, to be in love with this
foolish sin of poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Are you, sir? there's great hopes of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> And the reason is, because they say 'tis
both the cause and effect of a good wit, to which I
can sufficiently pretend: for Nature has not played
the stepdame with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> In good time, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> And now you talk of time, what time of
day is it by your watch?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I have none, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> How, ne'er a watch? O, monstrous! how
do you consume your hours? Ne'er a watch! 'tis
the greatest solecism in society that e'er I heard
of: ne'er a watch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> How deeply you conceive of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> You have not a gentleman, that's a true
gentleman, without one; 'tis the main appendix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
to a plush lining: besides, it helps much to discourse;
for while others confer notes together, we
confer our watches, and spend good part of the day
with talking of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Well, sir, because I'll be no longer destitute
of such a necessary implement, I have a suit
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> A suit to me? Let it alone till I am a
great man, and then [<em>Aside.</em>] I shall answer you
with the greater promise and less performance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I hope, sir, you have that confidence I
will ask nothing to your prejudice, but what shall
some way recompense the deed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> What is't? Be brief: I am in that point
a courtier.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> 'Tis well. For my part, I am determined
to lay by all ensigns of my royalty for awhile, and
walk abroad under a mean coverture. Variety
does well; and 'tis as great delight sometimes to
shroud one's head under a coarse roof as a rich
canopy of gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> But what's your intent in this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I have a longing desire to see the fashions
of the vulgar, which, should I affect in mine own
person, I might divert them from their humours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
The face of greatness would affright them, as Cato
did the Floralia<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> from the theatre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Indeed familiarity begets boldness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> 'Tis true, indulgency and flattery take
away the benefit of experience from princes, which
ennobles the fortunes of private men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> But you are a duke, sir; and this descent
from your honour will undervalue you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Not a whit. I am so toiled out with
grand affairs and despatching of embassages, that
I am ready to sink under the burden. Why may
not an Atlas of state, such as myself, that bears
up the weight of a commonwealth, now and then,
for recreation's sake, be glad to ease his shoulders?
Has not Jupiter thrown away his rays and his
thunder to walk among mortals? Does not
Apollo suffer himself to be deprived of his quiver,
that he may waken up his muse sometimes, and
sing to his harp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Nay, sir, to come to a more familiar example:
I have heard of a nobleman that has been
drunk with a tinker, and of a magnifico that has
played at blow-point.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Very good; then take our degrees alike,
and the act's as pardonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> In a humour, sir, a man may do much.
But how will you prevent their discovery of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Very well; the alteration of our clothes
will abolish suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> And how for our faces?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> They shall pass without any seal of disguise.
Who ne'er were thought on, will ne'er be
mistrusted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Come what will, greatness can justify any
action whatsoever, and make it thought wisdom;
but if we do walk undiscerned, 'twill be the better.
It tickles me to think what a mass of delight we
shall possess in being, as 'twere, the invisible spectators
of their strange behaviours. I heard, sir,
of an antiquary who, if he be as good at wine as
at history, he is sure an excellent companion: and
of one Petrucio, who plays the eagle in the clouds:
and indeed divers others, who verify the proverb,
<em>So many men, so many humours.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> All these we'll visit in order: but how
we shall comply with them, 'tis as occasion shall
be offered; we will not now be so serious to consider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Well, sir, I must trust to your wit to
manage it. Lead on; I attend you.       <span class="directline">[<em>Exeunt.</em></span></p></div>

celebrated with public sports on the 5th of the Kalends of
May. The chief part of the "solemnity was managed by a
company of lewd strumpets, who ran up and down naked,
sometimes dancing, sometimes fighting, or acting the mimic.
However it came to pass, the wisest and gravest Romans
were not for discontinuing this custom, though the most
indecent imaginable: for Portius Cato, when he was present
at these games, and saw the people ashamed to let the
women strip while he was there, immediately went out of
the theatre to let the ceremony have its course."&mdash;Kennet's

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Good sir, consider, 'tis no benefit to me:
he is your nephew that I speak for, and 'tis charity
to relieve him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> He is a young knave, and that's crime
enough; and he were old in anything, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
'twere in iniquity, there were some reverence to be
had of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Why, sir, though he be a young knave, as
you term him, yet he is your kinsman, and in
distress too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Why, sir, and you know again, that 'tis
an old custom (which thing I will no way transgress)
for a rich man not to look upon any as his
kinsman in distress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> 'Tis an ill custom, sir, and 'twere good
'twere repealed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> I have something else to look after. Have
you disposed of those relics, as I bad you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Well, thou dost not know the estimation
of what thou hast in keeping. The whole Indies,
seeing they are but newly discovered, are not to
be valued with them: the very dust that cleaves
to one of those monuments is more worth than the
ore of twenty mines!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Yet, by your favour, sir, of what use can
they be to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> What use! Did not the Signiory build
a state-chamber for antiquities? and 'tis the best
thing that e'er they did: they are the registers,
the chronicles, of the age they were made in, and
speak the truth of history better than a hundred
of your printed commentaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Yet few are of your belief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> There's a box of coins within, most of
them brass, yet each of them a jewel, miraculously
preserved in spite of time or envy; and are of that
rarity and excellence that saints may go a pilgrimage
to them, and not be ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Yet, I say still, what good can they do to
you, more than to look on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> What good, thou brute! And thou wert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
not worth a penny, the very showing of them were
able to maintain thee. Let me see now, and you
were put to it, how you could advance your voice
in their commendation. Begin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> All you gentlemen that are affected with
such rarities,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> the world cannot produce the like,
snatched from the jaws of time, and wonderfully
collected by a studious antiquary, come near and
admire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Thou say'st right: the limbs of Hippolitus
were never so dispersed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> First, those twelve pictures that you see
there, are the portraitures of the Sibyls, drawn
five hundred years since by Titianus of Padua, an
excellent painter and statuary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Then here is Venus all naked, and Cupid
by her, on a dolphin: both these were drawn by
Apelles of Greece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Proceed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Then here is Hercules and Ant&aelig;us; and
that Pallas at length in alabaster, with her helmet
and feathers; and that's Jupiter, with an eagle at
his back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Exceeding well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Then there's the great silver box that
Nero kept his beard in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Good again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> And after decking it with precious stones,
did consecrate it to the Capitol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> That's right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> And there hangs the net that held Mars
and his mistress, while the whole bench of bawdy
deities stood spectators of their sport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Admirable good!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Then here is Marius to the middle,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and

next to her, Marcus Antonius, the Triumvir; then
he with half a nose is Corvinus, and he with ne'er
a one is Galba.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Very sufficient!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Then here is Vitellius, and there Titus
and Vespasian: these three were made by Jacobus
Sansovinus the Florentine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> 'Tis enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> For their worth I will not promise: 'tis
as you please to esteem of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> No doubt, sir, we shall ascribe what dignity
belongs to them and to you their preserver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> You speak nobly; and thus much let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>tell you, to your edifying: the foolish doating on
these present novelties is the cause why so many
rare inventions have already perished; and (which
is pity) antiquity has not left so much as a foot-step
behind her, more than of her vices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> 'Tis the more pity, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Then, what raises such vanities amongst
us, and sets fantastical fancies awork? What's
the reason that so many fresh tricks and new inventions
of fashions and diseases come daily over
sea, and land upon a man that never durst adventure
to taste salt water, but only the neglect of
those useful instructions which antiquity has set
down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> You speak oracles, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Look farther, and tell me what you find
better or more honourable than age. Is not
wisdom entailed upon it? Take the preheminence
of it in everything&mdash;in an old friend, in old wine,
in an old pedigree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> All this is certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> I confess to you, gentlemen, I must reverence
and prefer the precedent times before these,
which consumed their wits in experiments: and
'twas a virtuous emulation amongst them, that
nothing which should profit posterity should
perish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> It argued a good fatherly providence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> It did so. There was Lysippus, that
spent his whole life in the lineaments of one picture,
which I will show you anon: then was there
Eudoxus the philosopher,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> who grew old in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>top of a mountain, to contemplate astronomy;
whose manuscript I have also by me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Have you so, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> I have that, and many more; yet see the
preposterous desires of men in these days, that
account better of a mass of gold than whatever
Apelles or Phidias have invented!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> That is their ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Well, gentlemen, because I perceive you
are ingenious, I would entreat you to walk in,
where I will demonstrate all, and proceed in my
admonition.                              <span class="directline">[<em>Exeunt.</em></span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> 'Tis well, sir: I am glad you are so soon
got free from your bondage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> Yes, I thank my stars, I am now my own
man again; I have slept out my drunken fit of
love, and am recovered. You, that are my friends,
rejoice at my liberty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Why, was it painful to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> More tedious than a siege. I wonder
what black leaf in the book of fate has decreed
that misery upon man&mdash;to be in love; it transforms
him to a worse monster than e'er Calypso's
cup did: [or] a country gentleman among courtiers,
or their wives among the ladies. A clown
among citizens, nay, an ass among apes, is not half
so ridiculous as that makes us. O that I could
but come by it, how would I tear it, that never
such a witched<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> passion should arise in any human

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> You are too violent in your hate: you
should never so fall out with a friend as to admit
no hope of reconcilement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> I'll first be at peace with a serpent. Mark
me, if thou hast care of thy time, thy health, thy
fame, or thy wits, avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I must confess, I have been a little vain
that way, yet never so transported, but when I
saw a handsomer in place, I could leave the former
and cleave to the latter. I was ever constant to
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> Hold thee there still, and if there be a
necessity at any time that thou must be mad, let
it be a short fury, and away: let not this paltry
love hang too long upon the file; be not deluded
with delays; for if these she-creatures have once
the predominance, there shall be no way to torture
thee but they'll find it out, and inflict it without
mercy: they'll work on thy disposition, and if
thou hast any good-nature, they'll be sure to abuse
thee extremely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Speak you this in earnest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> I know not what you call earnest, but
before I'll endure that life again, I'll bind myself
to a carrier, look out any employment whatever,
spend my hours in seeing motions and puppet-plays,
rook at bowling-alleys, mould tales, and vent
them at ordinaries, carry begging epistles, walk
upon projects, transcribe fiddlers' ditties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> O monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> But since I have tasted the sweetness of
my freedom, thou dost not know what quickness
and agility is infused into me. I feel not that
weight was wont to clog me, wherever I went; I

my mortality! I hear not my thoughts whisper to
me, as they were wont&mdash;Such a man is your rival;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>

Petro.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> He says, moreover, that it may stand you

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Sure, you must needs be very strong then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bravo.</span> Not so neither; 'tis courage in me. I
do it by a sleight, an activity, and by that I can
control any man's point whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Is it possible?</p>

for, and they were to perform again, they would

them all like a gangrene, and men will die

you compass it? Were you not best poison him,
think you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bravo.</span> With a bullet or stiletto. Poison him!
I scorn to do things so poorly; no, I'll use valour
in my villany, or I'll do nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> You speak honourably: and, now I think
on't, what if you beat him well-favouredly, and
spare his life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bravo.</span> Beat him! stay there; I'll kill him for

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Pray, sir, when saw you that thrice noble

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Thrice noble and accomplish'd! there's a
new style thrust upon me.             <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> It pleased the indulgency of my fate to
bless me with his company this morning, where he
himself was no less favourable to grace me with
the perusal of a madrigal or an essay of beauty,
which he had then newly compos'd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Well, gallants, either my understanding
misinforms me, or he is one of the most rare and
noble-qualified pieces of gentility, that ever did
enrich our climate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Believe it, sir, 'twere a kind of profanation
to make doubt of the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> How happy am I in such acquaintance!
A man shall have his due, when your meaner
society has neither judgment to discern worth, nor
credit to commend it.               <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> 'Twas my happiness, th' other day, to be
in the presence with certain ladies, where I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
him the most extolled and approved: one of them
was not ashamed to pronounce it openly, that she
would never desire more of heaven, than to enjoy
such a man for her servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> It shall be my next employment to inquire
out for that lady.                   <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> 'Tis a miracle to me how, in so small a
competency of time, he should arrive to such an
absolute plenitude of perfection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> No wonder at all; a man that has travelled,
and been careful of his time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> But, by your favour, sir, 'tis not every man's
happiness to make so good use on't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I'll resolve you something: there is as
great a mystery in the acquisition of knowledge, as
of wealth. Have you not a citizen will grow rich
in a moment, and why not he ingenious? Besides,
who knows but he might have digged for it, and
so found out some concealed treasure of understanding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Now, as I am truly noble, 'tis a wrongful
imputation upon me.               <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Well, if he had but bounty annexed to his
other sufficiencies, he were unparalleled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Nay, there's no man in the earth more
liberal: take it upon my word, he has not that
thing in the world so dear or precious in his esteem,
which he will not most willingly part with upon
the least summons of his friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Now must I give away some two or three

assertion.                        <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Why, this has some taste in't: how should
he arrive to this admirable invention?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Are you so preposterous in your opinion,
to think that wit and elegancy in writing are only
confined to stagers and book-worms? 'Twere a
solecism to imagine that a young bravery, who lives
in the perpetual sphere of humanity, where every
waiting-woman speaks perfect Arcadia,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and the
ladies lips distil with the very quintessence of
conceit, should be so barren of apprehension, as
not to participate of their virtues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Now I consider, they are great helps to a
man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> But when he has travelled, and delibated
the French<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and the Spanish; can lie a-bed, and

and when he is up, accost his mistress with what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>he had read in the morning; now, if such a one
should rack up his imagination, and give wings to
his muse, 'tis credible, he should more catch your
delicate court-ear, than all you head-scratchers,
thumb-biters, lamp-wasters of them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Well, I say the iniquity of fortune appears
in nothing more, than not advancing that man to
some extraordinary honours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> But I never thought he had any genius
that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> What, because he has been backward to
produce his good qualities? Believe it, poetry
will out; it can no more be hid than fire or love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> I'll break them off, they have e'en spoken
enough in my behalf for nothing, o' conscience.      [<em>Aside.</em>]
Save you, Cavalieros!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> My much honoured Petrucio, you are
welcome; we were now entered into a discourse of
your worth. Whither do your occasions enforce
you so fast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Gentlemen, to tell you true, I am going
upon some raptures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Upon raptures, say you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Yes, my employment is tripartite: I have
here an anagram to a lady I made of her name this
morning, with a poesy to another, that must be inserted
into a ring; and here's a paper carries a
secret word too, that must be given, and worn by
a knight and tilter; and all my own imaginations,
as I hope to be blessed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Is't possible? how, have you lately drunk
of the horsepond,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> or stepped on the forked Parnassus,
that you start out so sudden a poet?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Tut! I leave your Helicons and your pale
Pirenes,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> to such as will look after them. For my
own part, I follow the instigation of my brain, and
scorn other helps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Do you so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> I'll justify it: the multiplicity of learning
does but distract a man. I am all for your modern
humours, and when I list to express a passion, it
flows from me with that spring of amorous conceits,
that a true lover may hang his head over, and
read in it the very phys'nomy of his affection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> And when my head labours with the pangs
of delivery, by chance up comes a countess's waiting-woman,
at whose sight, as at the remembrance
of a mistress, my pen falls out of my hand; and
then do I read to her half-a-dozen lines, whereat
we both sit together, and melt into tears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Pitiful-hearted creatures!                      <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Shall the duke take notice of me too? O

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I'll bring you to him, believe me, and
you know not what grace he may do you.</p>

you all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Gentles, I would intreat you a courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> What's that, signior?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> That you would be all pleas'd to grace my
lodging to-morrow at a banquet: there will be
ladies and gallants; and among the rest, I'll send
to invite your uncle the Antiquary; and we'll be
very merry, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Well, sir, your bounty commands us not
to fail you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Bounty! there's a memorandum for me.

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> They are too good for you. With what
face dare you approach hither, knowing how infinitely
you have abused me? You want matter to
exercise your wits on; the world's too wise for you;
and, ere you ensnare me again, you'll have good
luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Pray, sir, do not reiterate those things
which might better be forgotten. I confess I have
done ill, because I am a woman and young, and
'will be nobleness in you not to remember it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> I'll sooner plough up [the] shore and sow
it, and live in expectation of a crop, before I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
think the least good from any of your sex, while

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> I hope, sir, that time and experience will

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> I'll trust my ship to a storm, my substance
to a broken citizen, ere I'll credit any of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Good sir, be intreated: I come a penitent
lover, with a vow'd recantation to all former practices
and malicious endeavours, that I have wrought
against you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> How can I think better of you, when I
consider your nature, your pride, your treachery,
your covetousness, your lust; and how you commit
perjury easier than speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Sure, 'tis no desert in us, but your own
misguided thoughts that move in you this passion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> Indeed, time was I thought you pretty
foolish things to play withal, and was so blinded
as to imagine that your hairs were golden threads,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
that your eyes darted forth beams, that laughter
sat smiling on your lips, and the coral itself looked
pale to them: that you moved like a goddess, and
diffused your pleasures wide as the air: then could
I prevent the rising sun<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> to wait on you, ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>served
every nod you cast forth, had the patience
to hear your discourse, and admired you, when you
talked of your visits, of the court, of councils, of
nobility, and of your ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> And were not these pleasing to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> Nothing but a heap of tortures: but since
I have learned the Delphic Oracle, to <em>know myself</em>,
and ponder what a deal of mischief you work, I am
content to live private and solitary, without any
pensive thought what you do, or what shall become
of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Sir, if you calculate all occasions, I have
not merited this neglect from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> Yes, and more. Do you not remember
what tasks you were wont to put me to, and expenses?
when I bestowed on you gowns and petticoats,
and you in exchange gave me bracelets and
shoe-ties? how you fooled me sometimes, and set
me to pin plaits in your ruff, two hours together,
and made a waiting frippery of me? how you
racked my brain to compose verses for you&mdash;a
thing I could never abide? Nay, in my conscience,
and I had not took courage, you had brought me
to spin, and beat me with your slippers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Well, sir, I perceive you are resolved to
hear no reason; but, before my sorrowful departure,
know she that you slight is the preserver
of your life; therefore I dare be bold to call you
ingrate, and in that I have spoke all that can be
ill in man.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aur.</span> Pray, stay; come back a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Not till you are better-tempered. What
I have revealed is true; and though you prove unthankful,
good deeds reward themselves: the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>science

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Has he such rare things, say you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Yes, sir, I believe you have not seen the
like of them: they are a couple of old manuscripts,
found in a wall,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> and stored up with the foundation;
it may be they are the writings of some
prophetess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> What moves you to think so, Petro?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Because, sir, the characters are so imperfect;
for time has eaten out the letters, and the
dust makes a parenthesis<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> betwixt every syllable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> A shrewd, convincing argument! this

a man may purchase them for little or nothing&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Come near, friend, let me see what you have there.
Umph, 'tis, as I said, they are of the old Roman
binding. What's the price of these?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I would be loth, sir, to sell them under rate,
only to merit laughter for my rashness; therefore I
thought good to bestow them on you, and refer myself
to your wisdom and free nature for my satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> You say well; then am I bound again in
conscience to deal justly with you: will five hundred
crowns content you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I'll demand no more, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Petro, see them delivered. Now I need
not fear to tell you what they are: this is a book
<em>de Republica</em>, 'tis Marcus Tullius Cicero's own hand
writing; I have some other books of his penning
give me assurance of it.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> And what's the other, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> This other is a book of mathematics, that
was long lost in darkness, and afterwards restored
by Ptolemy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I wonder, sir, unless you were Time's secretary,
how you should arrive to this intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> I know it by more than inspiration. You
had them out of a wall, you say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Well, then, however you came by them,
they were first brought to Venice by Cardinal
Grimani,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> a patriarch, and were digged out of the
ruins of Aquileia, after it was sacked by Attila
king of the Huns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> This to me is wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Petro, I mean to retire, and give myself
wholly to contemplation of these studies; and because
nothing shall hinder me, I mean to lease out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>my lands and live confined: inquire me out a
chapman that will take them of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> If you please to let them, sir, I will help
you to a tenant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Will you, sir? with all my heart, and I'll
afford him the better bargain for your sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> He may pay the rent with counters, and
make him believe they are antiquities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> What's the yearly rent of them, Petro?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> They have been racked, sir, to three thousand
crowns; but the old rent was never above
fifteen hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Go to, you have said enough; I'll have
no more than the old rent. Name your man, and
the indentures shall be drawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Before I propose that, sir, I thought good to
acquaint you with a specialty I found among other
writings which, having a seal to it and a name
subscribed, does most properly belong to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Let me see it. What's here? Signior
Giovanni Veterano di Monte Nigro! He was my
great grandfather, and this is an old debt of his
that remains yet uncancelled. You could never
have pleased me better to my cost: this ought, in
conscience, to be discharged, and I'll see it satisfied
the first thing I do. Come along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Will you afford your nephew no exhibition
out of your estate, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Not a sol; not a gazet.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> I have articles
to propose before the senate shall disinherit him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Have you, sir? Not justly, I hope. Pray,
what are they?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> One of them is, he sent me letters beyond
sea, dated <em>Stilo Novo.</em><a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> That was a great oversight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Then you remember, Petro, he took up
commodities, new-fashioned stuffs, when he was
under age, too, that he might cosen his creditors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pet.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> And afterwards found out a new way to
pay them, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> He served them but in their kind, sir:
perhaps they meant to have cheated him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> 'Tis all one; I'll have no such practices.
But the worst of all: one time, when I found him
drunk, and chid him for his vice, he had no way
to excuse himself, but to say, he would become a
new man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> That was heinously spoken, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> These are sufficient aggravations to any
one that shall understand my humour.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Pray, sir, be comforted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Comfort! no, I despise it: he has given
me daggers to my heart!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> Show yourself a man, sir, and contemn
the worst of fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Good sir, could not you have invented a
less studied way of torture to take away my
life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I hope 'twill not work so deeply with
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Nay, and 'twould stop there, 'twere well;
but 'tis a punishment will follow me after death,
and afflict me worse than a fury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo.</span> I much pity the gentleman's case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> Think what 'tis to lose a son when you
have brought him up, or, after a seven years'
voyage, to see your ship sink in the harbour!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> 'Twere a woeful spectacle, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> They are but tickling to this: I have been
all my life a-gathering what I must now lose in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
moment. The sacking of a city is nothing to be

after it, I'll die within a month, and set you down
all joint executors.</p>

his imposition, will you not recant?</p>

entreat your advice here to the clearing of a
doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> What's that, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> 'Tis concerning the boy you placed with
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Ay, what of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Whether it were an enchantment or no,
or an illusion of the sight, or if I could persuade
myself it was a dream, 'twere better; but my
imagination so persuaded me, that I heard my
wife and him interchanging amorous discourse
together. To what an extremity of passion the
frailty of man's nature might induce me to!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Very good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Not very good, neither; but, after the
expense of so much anger and distraction, my wife
comes upon me again, and affirms that he is no
boy, but a disguised mistress of my own, and upon
this swells against me, as if she had lain all night
in the leaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Have not I reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Pray, sir, will you inform us of the verity
of his sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Then take it upon my word, 'tis a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Now, sir, what have you to answer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> I am not yet thoroughly satisfied; but if
it be a woman, I must confess my error.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> What satisfaction's that, after so great a
wrong, and the taking away of my good name?
You forget my deserts, and how I brought you a
dowry of ten talents: besides, I find no such superfluity
of courage in you to do this, neither.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Well, were he a boy or no, 'tis more than
I can affirm; yet this I'll swear, I entertained him
for no mistress, and, I hope, you for no servant;
therefore, good wife, be pacified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> No, sir, I'll call my kindred and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
friends together, then present a joint complaint of
you to the senate, and if they right me not, I'll
protest there's no justice in their court or government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> If she have this plea against me, I must
make my peace; she'll undo me else.      [<em>Aside.</em>]
Sweet wife, I'll ask thee forgiveness upon my
knees, if thou wilt have me: I rejoice more that
thou art clear, than I was angry for the supposed
offence. Be but patient, and the liberty thou
enjoyedst before shall be thought thraldom hereafter.
Sweet sir, will you mediate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Come, sweet lady, upon my request you
shall be made friends; 'twas but a mistake; conceive
it so, and he shall study to redeem it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Well, sir, upon this gentleman's intreaty,
you have your pardon. You know the propensity
of my disposition, and that makes you so bold
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Pray, Master Lionel, will you acquaint my
wife with the purpose of this concealment; for I
am utterly ignorant, and she has not the patience
to hear me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> It requires more privacy than so, neither
is it yet ripe for projection; but because the community
of counsel is the only pledge of friendship,
walk in, and I'll acquaint you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Honest, sweet wife, I thank thee with all
my heart.                              <span class="directline">[<em>Exeunt.</em></span></p></div>

On this passage Dr Newton observes, that "ambergris,
or grey amber, is esteemed the best, and used in perfumes
and cordials." A curious lady communicated the following
remarks upon this passage to Mr Peck, which we will here
transcribe: "<em>Grey amber</em> is the amber our author here
speaks of, and melts like butter. It was formerly a main
ingredient in every concert for a banquet&mdash;viz., to fume the
meat with, and that whether boiled, roasted, or baked;
laid often on the top of a baked pudding; which last I have
eat of at an old courtier's table. And I remember, in our
old chronicle there is much complaint of the nobilities being
made sick, at Cardinal Wolsey's banquets, with rich scented
cates and dishes most costly dressed with <em>ambergris</em>. I also
recollect I once saw a little book writ by a gentlewoman of
Queen Elizabeth's Court, where ambergris is mentioned as
the <em>haut-gout</em> of that age." So far this curious lady; and
Beaumont and Fletcher, in the "Custom of the Country,"
act iii. sc. 2&mdash;

It appears also to have been esteemed a restorative, being

<p><a name="Footnote_357_357" id="Footnote_357_357"></a><a href="#FNanchor_357_357"><span class="label">[357]</span></a> Rustic meetings of festivity, at particular seasons, were
formerly called <em>ales</em>; as Church-ale, Whitsun-ale, Bride-ale,
Midsummer-ale, &amp;c. Carew, in his "Survey of Cornwall,"
edition 1769, p. 68, gives the following account of the
Church-ale; with which, it is most likely, the others
agreed:&mdash;"For the church-ale, two young men of the parish
are yerely chosen by their last foregoers, to be wardens;
who, dividing the task, make collection among the parishioners,
of whatsoever provision it pleaseth them voluntarily to
bestow. This they imploy in brewing, baking, and other
acates, against Whitsontide; upon which holydayes the
neighbours meet at the church-house, and there merily
feede on their owne victuals, contributing some petty portion
to the stock; which by many smalls, groweth to a
meetly greatnes; for there is entertayned a kinde of emulation
betweene these wardens, who by his graciousnes in
gathering, and good husbandry in expending, can best advance
the churches profit. Besides, the neighbour parishes
at those times lovingly visit one another, and this way
frankely spend their money together. The afternoones are
consumed in such exercises as olde and yong folke (having
leysure) doe accustomably weare out the time withall."&mdash;&mdash;In
the subsequent pages, Carew enters into a defence of
these meetings, which in his time had become productive of
riot and disorder, and were among the subjects of complaint
by the more rigid puritans. For an account of <em>Maid
Marian</em>, see Mr Tollet's Dissertation at the end of the
"First Part of Henry IV." [But see both subjects copiously

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Now, Signor Mocinigo, what haste requires

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Marry, sir, this. You brought me once
into a paradise of pleasure and expectation of much
comfort; my request therefore is, that you would
no longer defer what then you so liberally promised.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Why, sir, in joining that beauteous lady,
your daughter, and myself in the firm bonds of
matrimony; for I am somewhat impatient of delay
in this kind, and indeed the height of my blood
requires it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> 'Tis an honest and a virtuous demand, and
on all sides an action of great consequence; and,
for my part, there's not a thing in the world I
could wish sooner accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> There's another branch of policy, besides
the coupling of you together, which springs from
the fruitfulness of my brain, that I as much labour
to bring to perfection as the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> What's that, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> A device upon the same occasion, but with
a different respect; 'tis to be imposed upon Petrucio.
I hate to differ so much from the nature of
an Italian, as not to be revengeful; and the occasion
at this time was, he scorned the love of her,
that you now so studiously affect; but I'll fit him
in his kind.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Did he so? He deserves to have both
his eyes struck as blind as Cupid's, his master,
that should have taught him better manners. But
how will you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> There's one Lionel, an ingenious witty gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Ay, that he is, as ever breathed, husband,
upon my knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Well, he is so, and we two have cast to
requite it upon him. The plot, as he informs me,
is already in agitation, and afterwards, sans delay,
I'll bestow her upon you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> But you may be deceived.       <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Still you engage me more and more your

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> If I can bring both these to success, as
they are happily intended, I may sit down, and,
with the poet, cry, <em>Jamque opus exegi.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Would I could say so too; I wish as much,
but 'tis you must confirm it, fair mistress: one
bare word of your consent, and 'tis done. The
sweetness of your looks encourage me, that you
will join pity with your beauty; there shall be

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> How now, Signor! What, love and
poetry, have they two found you out? Nay, then
you must conquer. Consider this, daughter; show
thy obedience to Ph&#339;bus and god Cupid: make an
humble professor of thyself; 'twill be the more acceptable,

well done; I am loth to importune her too much,
for fear of a repulse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Marry, come up, sir; you are still usurping
in my company. Is this according to the
articles proposed between us, that I should bear
rule and you obey with silence? I had thought
to have endeavoured for persuasion, but because
you exhort me to it, I'll desist from what I
intended: I'll do nothing but of my own accord,
I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Mum! wife, I have done. This we, that
are married, must be subject to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> You give an ill example, Mistress &AElig;milia;

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Where has he had his breeding, I wonder?
He is the offspring of some peasant, sure! Can he
show any pedigree?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Let her alone, there's no dealing with her.
Come, daughter, let me hear your answer to this
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Truly, sir, I have endeavoured all means
possible, and in a manner enforced myself to love
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Well said, girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> But could never effect it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> How!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> I have examined whatever might commend
a gentleman, both for his exterior and inward
abilities; yet, amongst all that may speak him
worthy, I could never discern one good part or
quality to invite affection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> This is it I feared. Now should I break
out into rage; but my wife and a foolish nature
withhold my passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> I am undone, unspirited, my hopes vain,
and my labours nullities!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Where be your large vaunts now, Signor?
What strange tricks and devices you had to win a
woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Such assurance I conceived of myself; but
when they affect wilful stubbornness, lock up their
ears, and will hearken to no manner of persuasion,
what shall a man do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> You hear what taxes are laid upon you,
daughter: these are stains to your other virtues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Pray, sir, hear my defence. What sympathy
can there be between our two ages or agreement
in our conditions? But you'll object, he has
means. 'Tis confess'd; but what assurance has
he to keep it? Will it continue longer than the
law permits him possession, which will come like
a torrent, and sweep away all? He has made a
forfeiture of his whole estate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> What, are you become a statist's daughter<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Take heed how you traduce a person of
his rank and eminency: a scar in a mean man
becomes a wound in a greater.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> There he is, question him; and if he deny
it, get him examined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Why, signor, is this true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> His silence betrays him: 'tis so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> 'Tis so, that all women thirst man's overthrow;
that's a principle as demonstrative as

when they have once insinuated themselves into

fire is more merciful; it burns within them till it
get forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> I commend her for the discovery: 'twas
not fit her weak thoughts should be clogged with
so foul a matter. It had been to her like forced
meat to a surfeited stomach, that would have bred
nothing but crudities in her conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> O my cursed fate! shame and punishment

all that I did was for her ease and liberty.       <span class="directline">[<em>Aside.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Nay, sir, he was so impudent to be an
accessory. Who knows but he might as privately
have plotted to have sent me after him; for how
should I have been secure of my life when he made
no scruple to kill another upon so small an inducement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Thou sayest right, daughter; thou shalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
utterly disclaim him. The cast of his eye shows
he was ever a knave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> How the scabs descant upon me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> What was the motive to this foul attempt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Why, sir, because he was an affectionate
lover of mine, and for no other reason in the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> O mandrake, was that all? He thought,
belike, he should not have enough. Thou covetous
engrosser of venery. Why, one wife is able to
content two husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moc.</span> Sir, I am at your mercy: bid them not
insult upon me. I beseech you, let me go as I
came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Stay there; I know not how I shall be
censured for your escape. I may be thought a
party in the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Besides, I hear since that the mercenary
varlet that did it, though he be otherwise most
desperate and hardened in such exploits, yet out
of the apprehension of so unjust an act, and moved
in conscience for so foul a guilt, is grown distracted,
raves out of measure, confesses the deed, accuses
himself and the procurer, curses both, and will by
no means be quieted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Where is that fellow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Sir, if you please to accompany me, I will
bring you to him, where your own eye and ear shall
witness the certainty; and then, I hope, you will
repent that ever you sought to tie me to such a
monster as this, who preferred the heat of his
desires before all laws of nature or humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lor.</span> Yes, that I will, and gratulate the subtlety
of thy wit, and goodness of fate, that protected
thee from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&AElig;mi.</span> Away with him, husband: and be sure to
beg his lands betimes, before your court-vultures
scent his carcase.</p>

authors; but the precise sense in which it is used is difficult
to be ascertained. In some places it seems to signify
<em>admonition</em> or <em>advice</em>; in others, <em>censure</em> or <em>reproof</em>. In
Lyly's "Euphues," p. 39, "Euphues, to the intent he
might bridle the overlashing affections of Philautus, conveied
into his studie a certeine pamphlet, which he tearmed
<em>A cooling card</em> for Philautus; yet generally to bee applyed
to all lovers."
</p>
<p>
So in the "First Part of Henry VI.," act v. sc. 4&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"There all is marr'd; there lies <em>a cooling card</em>."
</p>
<p>
And in the "Wounds of Civil War," 1594&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I'll have a present <em>cooling card</em> for you."
